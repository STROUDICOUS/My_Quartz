Hi Hazem,

Thanks for pointing out the repair works needed. Agreed, it’s absolutely imperative that we maintain the building to standard. I really think we need a house meeting with all of us present to go over an action plan. Will you join us at the next meeting? We are happy to host this in our garden or we can do it via video conference. Can you suggest a few dates and times you would be available for this? 

I’m really sorry the pipe is still dripping - this was supposed to have been repaired by the gutter cleaner. Unfortunately he didn’t seem to have done a very good job in this case. He also left our side of the pipe off and we had to get up there to put it back on. I chased him but he’s ignoring us. Can you take a video of the issue? 

We will need to get someone else in to fix it.

Thanks so much,
Taghrid
