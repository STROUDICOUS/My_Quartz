Hazem wanted many things - many things were actioned despite the undemocratic or forceful manner. e.g. Side gate. Despite our objection to the removal of our pushchair (Our moot objection still stands in relation to the Leasehold Agreement), we conceded that the pushchair was removed  - yet Hazem chose to send a solicitor's letter after its removal.
