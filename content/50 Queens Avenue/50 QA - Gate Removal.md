Hi PC Hussein,

We are in desperate need of help, so that we may again live peacefully in our home

On the 26th of August '23, you sat with us in our flat (address below) and listened to our deep concerns about the actions of our neighbour, Hazem El-Akhnawy, and you asked us to email you if he acted in a similar way again. You may remember that I was unable to speak at the time, due to a recent surgery on my vocal cords (my voice is back now).

Unfortunately, last night, Hazem removed the garden gate that provides access to the rear of our property.  It is now clear that Hazem has an unhealthy, anti-social, determination to make us suffer - an intention he openly stated and directed in the past to our elderly, upstairs neighbours. 

[Here is a link to a video showing the gate and access point for context.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1daec4h1v8xj6h4n49v6q/IMG_7422.MOV?rlkey=ex3xu4qsfewkh9jqn5axpw0sy&dl=0)  If it's more convenient, the QR code below will also take you there.  

This destruction of property and Hazem's past actions/behaviour have been harassing and intimidating in nature, with constant, spurious threats of legal action, threatening demands for money if his demands are not met - demanding payment for his solicitor or a professional that he threatens to hire at our expense.

His solicitor emailed me just seven days ago, giving me notice to remove it myself, citing that it had been illegally installed. 

We are desperate for this man to end his deeply distressing obsession with our misery. Surely, there must be legal recourse for our right to live in peace.

Subject: Urgent Request for Assistance - Ongoing Harassment from Neighbour

Dear PC Hussein,

I hope this message finds you well. We are in desperate need of help in addressing the continued harassment from our neighbour.

On the 26th of August '23, you visited us at our flat (address provided below), where we shared our deep concerns regarding the actions of our neighbour, Hazem El-Akhnawy. You kindly requested that we reach out via email if Hazem were to act similarly in the future. You may recall that, at that time, I was unable to speak due to a recent surgery on my vocal cords. I'm pleased to report that my voice has since recovered.

Regrettably, last night, Hazem took it upon himself to remove the garden gate that grants access to the rear of our property. This act underscores Hazem's persistent and unhealthy determination to cause us distress, a motive he has openly expressed in the past; directing his intent towards our elderly neighbours living upstairs; "I will make you suffer".

To provide you with a clear understanding of the situation, we have included a video illustrating the missing gate and access point. Alternatively, you can access the video via the QR code provided for your convenience.

The destruction of our property and Hazem's past behaviour have been nothing short of harassment and intimidation. He has consistently issued unfounded threats of legal action and demanded money, often attaching threats of hiring a solicitor or professional at our expense. A mere seven days ago, his solicitor contacted me, insisting that I remove the gate myself on the grounds that it had been illegally installed.

Unfortunately, the situation is further complicated because Hazem has garnered the support of our neighbour in Flat C. He has resorted to dishonesty and misrepresentation to convince them of his version of events, which has exacerbated our difficulties.

We are at a loss and desperately seek a resolution to end Hazem's deeply distressing obsession with making our lives miserable. Surely, there must be a legal avenue to uphold our fundamental right to live in peace.

We sincerely appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your past willingness to assist us. Your guidance and support would mean a great deal to us during this challenging time.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Warm regards,

Paul Stroud and Taghrid Choucair Vizoso

Dear PC Hussein,

I'm pleased to report that my voice has since recovered.

Unfortunately, Hazem's behaviour has escalated, with the latest incident involving the removal of the garden gate that grants access to the rear of our property, further underscoring his relentless and unhealthy determination to cause us distress, a motive he has openly expressed in the past; directing his hostile intent towards our elderly upstairs neighbours, yelling "I will make you suffer".

To provide you with a clear understanding of the situation, I have included a video illustrating the missing gate and access point. Alternatively, you can access the video via the QR code provided for your convenience.

The destruction of our property and Hazem's past behaviour can only be described as harassment and intimidation. He has consistently issued unfounded threats of legal action and demanded money, often attaching threats of hiring a solicitor or professional to be at our expense. A mere seven days ago, his solicitor contacted me, insisting that I remove the gate myself on the grounds that it had been illegally installed.

## To Solicitor 

Ask questions. Phrase my point as questions.
purport to be operating
What authority
please identify the authority that your client is relying upon inside the leasehold/freehold agreement under which your client removed the gate. 

1. It's unclear on what authority your client is acting on behalf of the entirety of the freehold without consultation of the freehold members.
2. please cite the section or clause that gives your client the authority to act unilaterally.
3. please explain the reasoning why your own client's plan has been omitted which clearly shows a gate in the location you of the one your client has taken down.
4. relied to remove a gate
5. Explain why your client's own plan should be disregarded.
6. Please provide the authority upon which your client is destroying of the rest of the freehold 
7. Please see your own clients 
8. In order to assess your own client's complaint, we need to review his own deed plan, which you have so far not supplied.
Please cite agreement 

to act unilaterally, let alone

he's not acting within the scope of the freehold agreement and so would constitute a destruction of property.

Dear Spyridon,

  

Your tone and demands are inappropriate and unwelcomed. I had made an initial estimate from memory. The gate I had installed has been in situ for ~3 years and 8 months. Below is a screenshot of the purchase details of the gate for reference.

  

As your client well knows, the presence of the gate has long been established. Flat D can likewise confirm that there has always been a gate in that location. In fact, as I understand it, your client's own plan clearly shows a gate in the location of the one your client has destroyed. Please explain why your client has failed to include his own plan in his allegations to date. In order to properly assess your client's complaint and his decision to destroy the gate, we need to review his deed plan, which you have thus far not supplied.


Please also identify the authority under which your client purports to be acting on behalf of the entirety of the freehold without proper consultation of all freehold members. Your client has failed to cite any section or clause in the relevant agreements that gives your client the authority to act unilaterally. As far as I can tell, your client has acted outside of the scope of the freehold agreements altogether.

  

Furthermore, please identify the legal grounds upon which your client believes that he can compel me, a leaseholder (the same as your client) and 25% share holder of the freehold company (also, the same as your client), to pay for his personal solicitor and other services that he alone sees fit to engage? Please also provide the authority upon which your client sees fit to issue arbitrary deadlines. 

  

Lastly, please also clarify, are you Hattie's lawyer as well? I'm confused as to why you're making demands to make good to Hattie’s fence if you are not her lawyer. 

  

Best,
Paul Stroud
