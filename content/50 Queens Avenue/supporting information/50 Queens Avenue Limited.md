- There are 4 shares @ £1 each
- Each flat has a share and is a director.
- I was Secretary from 2019 (when I moved in) but have recently resigned.
- Incorporated in 1997 by an formation agent (L&A)
- Since 1998 the company has filed accounts as 4 ordinary shares at £1 each. Nothing else
- I was late in filing accounts or confirmation statement for 2020 and 2021. I appealed the Late Filing penalty and was successful for 2020, but not 2021 where Companies House made me then pay for both years £300. 
- I asked the freehold to pay their portion of the fine, but there were objections from Flat C and (I think Flat B, but he has objected since via his solicitor and accountant). I dropped my claim and was never reimbursed.
- My predecessor had also incurred a late fine and the house reimbursed her. 
- I have yet to expense the cost incurred when submitting accounts to Companies House for 2020, 2021 and 2022: £13 each. **This is not important to me though**
