## Company number is 03399596
https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03399596

- There are 4 shares @ £1 each
- Each flat has a share and is a director.
- I was Secretary from 2019 (when I moved in) but have recently resigned.
- Incorporated in 1997 by an formation agent (L&A)
- Since 1998 the company has filed accounts as 4 ordinary shares at £1 each. Nothing else
- I was late in filing accounts or confirmation statement for 2020 and 2021. I appealed the Late Filing penalty and was successful for 2020, but not 2021 where Companies House made me then pay for both years £300. 
- I asked the freehold to pay their portion of the fine, but there were objections from Flat C and (I think Flat B, but he has objected since via his solicitor and accountant). I dropped my claim and was never reimbursed.
- My predecessor had also incurred a late fine and the house reimbursed her. 
- I have yet to expense the cost incurred when submitting accounts to Companies House for 2020, 2021 and 2022: £13 each. **This is not important to me though**- From [50 Queens Avenue Limited](./50 Queens Avenue Limited.md)

## Bank Account
- The bank account is a personal account of Flat D's used solely for the purposes of the company house account 
- I am a signatory on the passbook for the bank account but I did not use the account and did not reimburse myself nor anyone else.
- I did not [[../Hazem's Solicitor's Email re 50QA Accounts|'take the Barton']] on expenses as mentioned in the solicitors email. 
	- Flat A was a proactive member of the freehold and regularly participated in the up keep of the common areas, but did not administer the remuneration of any expense they or any other member of the freehold incurred. 
- Hattie Hughes was the first person to complain that accounts were not presented. 

Hazem did not attend house meetings with the exception of 17/09/2020. He attended after pleas from myself and my wife. 

Hazem and Hattie have historically been somewhat aligned on house matters. The details are probably not relevant right now, but I believe it was her inquiries and comments about the company and house account that led Hazem to make many misapprehensions.
