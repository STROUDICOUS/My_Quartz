In fact, the only substantive demands that I have denied Hazem are his demands for compensation against his solicitor's fees and written confirmation regarding items in the communal area. 
- [ ] #todo #backend  Add Property to all [[Contentious Issues Raised by Hazem|Contentious Issues Raised by Hazem]] 
Hazem wanted written confirmation from us that we would not leave the puschair or other personal items in the communal area. If the law is clear, my written confirmation can provide no more clarity and it not necessary. If the leasehold agreement is not clear enough that it requires us to provide clarification, then there was no foul in this regard. 
It is not for a leaseholder to provide clarification or a definition to the leasehold agreement. It is also not appropriate  for a leaseholder to make demands or requests from other leaseholders. Both of these actions provides a dangerous president to set. 
Importantly - the push chair was removed in accordance with 50% of the freehold wishes,

## Un-neighbourly and Un-cooperative Conduct
Here is a summary of Hazem's behaviour/actions
- Numerous demands/threats of reclaiming costs of experts to settle disputes. e.g. 
> 	- I will obtain a Fire Risk Assessment to establish whether the items cause a health and safety risk.[...] The cost of which will also be split between any of the flat(s) which seek to keep belongings in the communal area. 

- Use of demands and threats early in any discussion with no reasonable reminders or questions first - eg fire assessment and pushchair See 20210424 Hazem first Complains about communal area.PDF  https://www.dropbox.com/s/0s08ml6gkue4qdb/20210424%20Hazem%20first%20Complains%20about%20communal%20area.pdf?dl=0
- Unilateral action - Erecting a fence in dispute with our neighbour. No notice or discussion with the other freehold members of 50QA
- Constant surveilling and reporting to all freeholders with his complaints and photos of our property and belongings in the communal area.
- Time wasting on matters that were presented to him at the time of the matter. For any work or expenditure, notice and approval was sought prior to works or goods purchased, and notice of invoice and payment was also given. This solicitors email and accountants letter being a waste of time. 
- No request to see accounts outside of heavy handed correspondence from his accountant and solicitor.
- Unilaterally deciding to stop paying into the house fund
- Unilaterally overriding a decision by the other freeholders to increase the monthly 'service charge' 3 flats agreed to raise our monthly commitment from £50 to £60. 
- Overriding a 75% vote to keep the panels fitted to the side gate following complaints from Hazem that the wrong wood had been used by threatening to employ a structural engineer, the cost of which would be charged to anyone in disagreement with him. 
  >  re: Structural engineer for a garden gate.. 
> 	  I will instruct a structural engineer for which I will have to forward the costs on in addition to any solicitor costs

# ChatGPT Background
My wife and I have been targeted by our neighbour, Hazem. He lives in flat B, and we live in flat A. He also targets our neighbours, David and Adrian, who live in flat D. My wife and I moved in in March 2019. Hazem moved in in 2006, David and Adrian, since the late 90s and Hattie, who lives in flat C moved in in 2020.
Flats A, B, C and D are the only flats within the freehold. The residents of each flat on the leasehold for their flat. They are also a 25% shareholder of a company called 50 Queens Avenue Ltd. This company holds the deeds to the freehold, 50 Queens Avenue. This is a typical situation where leaseholders co-own the freehold. We are all responsible for the upkeep of the freehold area, and I believe we have a duty to make collective decisions about maintenance work, and cleaning, and anything else pertaining to the freehold property. 

I held the position of company secretary for three years, starting from when I moved in. David of flat D had a bank account that was separate, but linked to his personal bank account. I was also the signatory on the bank account in case of emergencies, but I have never made any transaction on the account. In previous years, David would inform the shareholders of the balance in the account together with any expected or recent outgoings. 

No bookkeeping was ever carried out. Until an email from Hattie (which I may discuss at some point), about two years ago, no one had made any suggestion that it ought to have been carried out. It is important to know that no previous tenant had made any objections to this fact or raised any concerns.  Neither has any conveyancing solicitor for recent residence/leaseholders.

As company secretary, I file confirmation statements and accounts to companies house on two occasions. I was late in supplying the accounts and was subsequently fined.  I bore the costs of those fines alone. 

In case it is relevant later in our conversation, Rob Graham (also known as Bobby Graham) and Pamela Learmonth were the previous owners of flat A. Bob and Mary Smart were the previous owners of flat C. 

Throughout this conversation, I want you to help me with my argument against Hazem and his solicitor, Spyridon Leoussis.

It is my contention that Hazem (on his own and through his solicitor) often communicates with the other directors/shareholders/leaseholders and takes action that is not, or goes against the interest of the company, 50 Queens Avenue Ltd. 

It is also my contention that he has breached the leasehold agreement, most notably by making alterations or carrying out works on the freehold/communal areas without the permission of the landlord, who, in this case, because of the company structure and each of us holding a 25% share of the company, we are all collectively "the landlord". His other notable breach of the leasehold agreement is not allowing other residents "peaceful enjoyment" of their property.

Throughout this conversation, I want you to consider any breach of law, legislation or agreement that Hazem has made—for example, the Companies Act 2006.

In this conversation, I may supply you with emails that may be to or from any of the people I have mentioned so far. I will ask you to pick out any potential infraction by Hazem as per my previous paragraph. 

Here are some of the infractions that I particularly want you to look out for, but if there is anything else in the evidence that I will supply you that you believe to be either nuisance behaviour, on neighbourly conduct, harassing in nature or any other breach I have mentioned thus far, please point these out to me. The infractions I have observed:
- arbitrary, unwarranted deadlines. 
-  coercive, financial ultimatums. He will often employ the formula. "if you do not agree to X works being carried out, I will employ a Y professional, and that will cost Z. If the professional fines in my favour, you will have to bear the full cost together with any legal expenses". 
- autocratic, unilateral action. e.g. Hazem has replaced the fence on the freehold boundary without first, discussing it with the other directors/shareholders, and without a vote. He has also installed CCTV cameras on the exterior of the building which is under the purview of the freehold. 
- precipitately threatening - Hazem escalates quickly.
- disruptive in action – Hazem often makes demands for works on the communal area. When he is invited to take action, as is his duty as director and share of freehold, he often fails to take any action or find any quotes from service providers. He my later resume his demands regarding the same issue.
- misrepresentation - Hazem will often misrepresent the facts. For example, he may say something like, "We agreed to the works being carried out back in 2020" when, in fact, evidence shows that the works were discussed, but not agreed upon. 
- promotes the narrative that he is the victim, whilst I, my wife, David and Adrienne are the aggressors. I may need your help in redirecting the narrative and opposing Hazem's.
-  Aggressive Behaviour - There is a recording of Hazem shouting at our elderly neighbours, David and Adrienne. "You haven't seen my bad side yet", "I have no problem,, you will have the problem in future". 
- demands without authority - Hazem has made many demands, even though he does not have the authority, individually, to make such demands.
Hazem has also maintained that David of flat D and I are liable for his legal costs in relation to numerous letters and emails sent by his solicitor. Many of these letters contain misrepresentations and falsehoods like those I mentioned earlier.  

He first demanded that I pay his solicitors fees in regard to my son's pushchair, which we often left in the communal area. Notably, the pushchair had been removed several weeks before the solicitor's letter had been sent. His very first communication about the pushchair, before the solicitors Leicester was sent, cited a clause in the leasehold agreement, gave a financial ultimatum where he said he would obtain a fire risk assessment, and that if the fire risk assessment found in his favour, anyone who disagreed with him would be liable to pay for that assessment in full. He made another demand without authority here, asking for written confirmation from leaseholders their intention to abide by their leasehold agreement. 

His action of sending a solicitors letter in regard to my son's pushchair has proven to be a threshold in the dispute between him and ourselves. Things have escalated from here.

It is my intention to present the case that will provide enough evidence to stop this undesired behaviour of Hazem's. This is primarily what I need your help with.  Not every piece of evidence I will enclose in this conversation may refer or relate to my previous notes. This is just back ground information about Hazem etc.

I will expand on the backstory and context throughout our conversation.

Recently has them solicitor provided this notice of application to appoint a manager for the freehold under section 22 of the landlord and tenant act 1987. I have uploaded the PDF of this to you

Here is the response from David. All of David's points and rebuttals against Hazem's Solicitor's assertions are correct:
Dear Mr Leoussis, As Freeholders and joint owners of Flat D, 50 Queens Avenue we agree with the need for an independent property management company without the need to pursue a court order. We understand that this is the preferred option of the freeholder of Flat C, We agree that given the breakdown in relations within the House this is probably the only way forward but would want to have input into the management company appointed. We also wish to respond to grounds presented in Schedule 3; a) I refute any allegations by your client of myself and my wife of any harassment or threats against him, indeed in the past your client has harassed us. There are no obstructions in the communal areas. Therefore, there is no breach. b) As far as I am aware trees in Flat A's garden have either been trimmed or removed. c) It is agreed that there are a number of maintenance issues that are to be addressed . Matters have been hampered by the breakdown in communication within the property specifically your client's willingness to engage, All Freeholders are responsible for maintenance and clearly given the breakdown in communication between all flats the only way forward is a property management company. d) The buildings insurance is valid. 50 Queens Avenue have used the same insurance broker for a number of years and this has always been accepted by all parties without complaint or concerns from the insurance companies involved. We are, therefore unsure of your point. e) There were over the years a number of meetings on a quarterly basis. Many of these meetings were not attended by your client but minutes were always circulated. Freeholders paid into a House Account which was on the basis of a Nationwide 'passbook'. There was no 'statement' of this account but at each, minuted meeting,freeholders were informed of the monies in the account, what had been spent and what would be required. The sums involved were originally £30 per month per flat and increased to £50 per month. There was never any objection to this. There was one anomaly which was quickly rectified and the freeholders reimbursed. All monies agreed for insurance purposes and for communal cleaning was agreed until recently due to your client and the Freeholder of Flat C opposing the increase in cost. This method of organising accounts has since been discontinued. As Freeholders we are all responsible for the present situation. Any allegations you appear to be making are therefore denied. f) The recent installation of security cameras was carried out on a unilateral basis without any reference to the 'Landlord' or discussion with myself or my wife. There was no warning, no communication, simply a de facto action. Your client may feel that this action was necessary, perhaps it is, but there was no communication or attempt to request agreement with us. We note in your email of 17/1/2024 that you seem to suggest we could be liable for your costs. We will not be paying your costs in any circumstances as, if your client had engaged properly, had observed the democratic process and not taken unilateral action, none of this would be necessary and your client must bear his own costs. In conclusion, There is clearly a need for an independent property management company and the need to treat our neighbours with courtesy and let us get on peacefully with our own lives.
