## Inaccuracies
- Hazem has not asked to see any accounts in my 4 years of being a director
	- neither David, or my Predecessor, whom I recently contacted regarding this matter,  has no recollection or record of Hazem requesting to see any accounts
- I inform all director/shareholders of account and confirmation statement submissions to Companies House. Not once has your client responded with any question. of this or with any suggestion that he shouldhave be consulted beforehand.
- David is not the chairman or the board. He is the treasurer - a required position to be filled By companies House. 
- The Company was not set up for the day to day of the freehold. It was set up as a mechanism to hold the interest of the respective flat owners' share of the freehold. ie The Company is the registered owner of the freehold, with each of the four leaseholders owning a 25% share. 

## Questions for my Tax lawyer
- Can I expense the cost of the solicitor to the company?
- Companies House recommended filling as a dormant company - was this correct?
- Am I at risk of any fine?
	- Is the cost of the fine a company expense or me or David?
	- Should the late fees be shared amongst the directors?
- Is Hazem's potential complaint in any way a failure of his duties as a director?

## Fear that I will be solely held accountable for any mis-filing of company accounts.

- ~~==No contract to pay maintanence fees==~~
	- Not in Memorandum of Association
	- ~~Not in Leashold agreement~~
		- ~~This impies that 'maintenance fees' could not be considered as turnover or capital, or asset, which means there would be no tax retuen needed or reason to report to companies house.~~
- ==Secretary reposibilites== seem to include filing, but not for the content.
	- Accounts are the reposibilites of the directrors
- When the company was incorporated, the ==company forming agent== did not see fit to advise or put in place any registration with HMRC for the purposes of tax, even though it would have been clear that money would be spent on maintaining the freehold.
	- This implies that there is also no current reason to pay tax or keep any other official accounts for 50QA.
	- This means  that if this is the way in which 50QA was set up, by professionals, then I cannot be reasonably held accountable (by lack of qualification) to change the status quo
- Since incororation, 50QA has had many ==conveyancy solicitors==  investigate the company, its filings, and incorporation documents etc . Not one has raised any issues with such arrangements.
	- This means  that I cannot be reasonably held accountable (by lack of qualification) to change the status quo
	- If the current shareholder's conveyance solicitors did not spot any error in accounts or 50QA's status or structure, then no single layperson (including myself) can be held accountable, or at the least any more accountable than 
- 
## Strategy ideas



### Late penalty response
The nature of my late penalty appeal was personal, so will not be sharing those details. However, I enclose related paragraphs and Companies House response. 


~~I would understand that it would be Hazem's duty to complain if he hadn't received accounts after asking, but as this is not the case, surely a complaint at this stage is working against the company he has a duty to. Surely it would be in his interest to make sure our submissions are correct rather sabotage?

~~In recent years, with the changing of directors and secretarys, and the passing of time, the kitty had often been referred to as the company account.~~ 



~~However, I'm certain that our submissions are in order, we don't need to submit to HMRC, our dormant status is legitimate.~~ 

###### Regarding 50 QA Ltd dormant status. 



### Draft

#### re: Role of the company and dormant status
I understand your clients complaint under the premise you have outlined, however, it has been made with the misapprehension of the role of the company. It seems the primary role of 50 Queens Avenue Limited has been to hold the asset of the freehold which is jointly owned by the shareholders as to avoid having to change the Land Registry entry each time a flat is sold and bought, which can  bevery costly.

#### No request to see accounts
In addition there seems to be some confusion over you client's claim that he had requested to see the accounts. Hazem has not asked to see any accounts in my 4 years of being a director.  Neither David, or my predecessor (Pamela Learmonth), whom I recently contacted regarding this matter, has any recollection or record of Hazem requesting to see any accounts.

With further conformation from the previous secretary, the bank account that all shareholders paid into was not in the company's name, and only acted as a simple kitty to put aside money for the buildings insurance and any work which was needed as required by our joint responibility as Landlord. Oftentimes, this kitty had been insufficient for the totally needs of the property maintenance, and in such cases, shareholders have either sought payment arrangements direct to the vendor from each shareholder or, with prior consent from the other shareholders, paid in full themselves, later being reimbursed by the other shareholders for their share of the cost, with invoices or receipts presented or with prior agreement in the case of cash payments. 

Given 50 Queens Avenue Limited's exemption to cororation tax and lack of company bank account, there are no Company Accounts 

###### Hazem abanodons account and arrears 
It may be useful for you to note that your client was often in arrears of the monthly contributions to the kitty, preferring instead to pay in bigger sums which on occasion put his contributions in advance of the mutually agreed Â£50 pcm. No one has or had any complaint at your clients payment structure. Eventually, your client made the decision to stop paying into the account altogether and since then, the freehold has been maintained; paying for goods and services as a 4-way split between the director/shareholder/leaseholders, with the bank account and notion of a kitty being abandoned.

Hazem's tenure as Director predates my own by 15 years. The role and status of the company was set out in 1997, so it's quite suprising that his inquiry as to its legitimacy is surfacing now. I suggest that if you or Hazem take issue with the format then perhaps the incorporating solicitor should be contacted. I am simply maintaining the status quo since incororation, as have all of my predecesors. 

###### No issues raised with conveyancy solicitors
It's worth pointing out that in the last four years alone, 2 conveyancy solicitors have looked at the details of the freehold company without any questions or complaints being raised. If this is an issue, why hasn't your client requested or raised the issue at a director/shareholder meeting? Instead, your client has actively refused to attend propsed meetings. And why has no conveyency solicitor, including Hazem's own, not raised this issue if it is a legitimate concern?
