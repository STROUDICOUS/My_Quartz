# Email from Hazem's Solicitor - NWL 
Below is the email I received from NWL solicitors with my comments inline. Please note, I have not responded to NWL.

This email was sent on Thursday 9th Feb 2023

[[2022-06-30|2022-06-30]]
Dear Sirs,

As you will be aware I act for Hazem El-Akhnawy in relation to 50 Queens Avenue, Muswell Hill, London, N10 3NU.

I am instructed that there have been ==successive years of financial mismanagement of the service charge accounts== of 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited, as set out extensively and quite clearly in inter-party correspondence to date. I am also instructed that my client’s accountant, Raheel Shams of Astute Accountants sent both of you letters dated 16th December 2022 which you have yet to respond to with any substantiveness. Mr Stroud, you purported to reply to this letter by email dated 6th January 2023. ==This failed to provide any actual information required under the terms of Mr Shams’ 16th December letter== You state “Neither David, my predecessor (Pamela Learmonth) or myself, have any recollection or record of Hazem requesting to see any accounts” This is untrue as ==my client had requested this information in the 17th September 2020 house meeting by my client and Harriet Hughes.== 

```ad-note

Minutes from this meeting do not reflect your clients claim. The minutes were circulated after the meeting and your client has not raised objection to them.
The term of the letter were misinformed as mentioned in my response. One cannot be expected to reply extensively to a letter which has fundamental facts wrong.
```


You also state “There are some extended details of purchases and payments for services from the account in David's name over the last 3 years which can be forwarded” please forward all of these documents for review, including specifically evidence of all communal expenses for the last 6 years (both invoices and evidence of payment for these expenses).

```ad-note

I am not responsible for the accounts that cover the costs of the insurance and minor repairs and sundries. 
```

As you may be aware Schedule Three of everyone’s lease requires the Freeholder to maintain accounts of actual expenditure and keep proper books of account of the sums received from each leaseholder in relation to service charges. 

```ad-note

Just sums received? The passbook has these details, but doesn't contain info on Payee as on most occasions expenses were reimbursed to one of the Flats, often in cash. In my limited capacity, it seems to me that Schedule 3 also says that lease holders may request only the last year of expenses, not 6 years.

```

The two of you had of course taken the baton of dealing with these expenses on behalf of 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited and you are therefore duty-bound to have maintained such records, which are awaited. 

```ad-note

I refute that I took the baton on this matter. Depending on the validity of the link between company and service charge, I do not recognise my responsibility to maintain such extensive records. [[Questions for my Solicitor#Service Charge|See Service Charge in Questions and Comments]]
```


You will also be aware of your responsibilities under the Companies Act 2006 section 388 which requires that Company records must be kept at its registered office address and must be made accessible for inspection by the Company’s officers.

```ad-note
Company accounts that are submitted as 4 share at £1 each, are available online. 
Does the service charge (if considered an actual service charge) fall under the name Company Records? 
```

Please be advised that depending on the information provided (or lack thereof) I am instructed to commence director disqualification proceedings against both Mr Stroud and Mr Jeffrey.

The required information set out above and in Mr Shams’ 20th December letter is required within 14 days of the date of this email, failing which I am instructed to issue the aforementioned proceedings and claim legal costs as part of such proceedings.

Kind regards,

``` ad-note
Details of each expenditure were on each occasion, discussed and distributed. Not one expenditure has taken place without information being passed to all freeholders
