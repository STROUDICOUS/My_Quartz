Dear Sir,

Thank you for your communication. I trust that you are aware that this is a non trading/dormant company. I have no awareness of .'mismanagement' or what you refer to as 'inter-party correspondence'. I am endeavouring to assemble the last 3 years of correspondence but it will be impossible for me to do so for the last six years. This was never requested and does not exist as far as I am aware.

There was, indeed, a House meeting on 17th Feb. 2020. There is no mention in the minutes of a request for 'accounts'. If you wish I will forward these minutes which were sent to all those who were present as indeed your client was. There are, indeed, many other minutes that go back a long way in which there is no concern about 'House Accounts' or requests for them.

The House Account for 50 Queens Avenue was essentially for payment of the annual buildings insurance and occasional outlays. Flats A, C and D paid into this on a regular basis. At first the payment was £30 per month and afterwards £50. Your client (Flat D} was not willing to pay on this regular basis and paid as a lump sum into the account as the situation required sometimes in arrears, sometimes in advance. The account was in the form of a Nationwide pass book which did not provide statements.

Regards,

David Jeffrey
