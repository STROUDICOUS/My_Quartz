Regarding the camera which can be seen from our garden. We can see the lens. It is normal for security cameras to have a wide-angle lens fitted. That model has a 2.8 - 12mm Lens, which (depending on the size of the sensor) would mean it is truly capable of capturing our garden. If the camera is positioned to capture Hazem's back door area, and I assume that's supposed to be the point, then it very likely captures our garden and us. Our fundamental right to privacy is a serious concern, and NOT a vehicle simply to harass Hazem. 


I've asked Hazem or his solicitor to provide me with the authority that compels me to pay for his own personal legal costs, but none have ever been provided. 


Hazem's "attempts at reconciliation" included repeatedly asserting that I am liable for his legal cost, and he continued his demand for a written confirmation that I would not leave personal belongings in the communal hallway.  I had to repeatedly insist, "Hazem, you have to let me finish a sentence". Indeed, everything was quite cordial and we were in fact, getting on very well.
