In fact, the only substantive demands that I have denied Hazem are his demands for compensation against his solicitor's fees and written confirmation regarding items in the communal area. 
- [ ] #todo #backend  Add Property to all [[../../Contentious Issues Raised by Hazem|Contentious Issues Raised by Hazem]] 
Hazem wanted written confirmation from us that we would not leave the puschair or other personal items in the communal area. If the law is clear, my written confirmation can provide no more clarity and it not necessary. If the leasehold agreement is not clear enough that it requires us to provide clarification, then there was no foul in this regard. 
It is not for a leaseholder to provide clarification or a definition to the leasehold agreement. It is also not appropriate  for a leaseholder to make demands or requests from other leaseholders. Both of these actions provides a dangerous president to set. 
Importantly - the push chair was removed in accordance with 50% of the freehold wishes, ^todo

## Un-neighbourly and Un-cooperative Conduct
Here is a summary of Hazem's behaviour/actions
- Numerous demands/threats of reclaiming costs of experts to settle disputes. e.g. 
> 	- I will obtain a Fire Risk Assessment to establish whether the items cause a health and safety risk.[...] The cost of which will also be split between any of the flat(s) which seek to keep belongings in the communal area. 

- Use of demands and threats early in any discussion with no reasonable reminders or questions first - eg fire assessment and pushchair See 20210424 Hazem first Complains about communal area.PDF  https://www.dropbox.com/s/0s08ml6gkue4qdb/20210424%20Hazem%20first%20Complains%20about%20communal%20area.pdf?dl=0
- Unilateral action - Erecting a fence in dispute with our neighbour. No notice or discussion with the other freehold members of 50QA
- Constant surveilling and reporting to all freeholders with his complaints and photos of our property and belongings in the communal area.
- Time wasting on matters that were presented to him at the time of the matter. For any work or expenditure, notice and approval was sought prior to works or goods purchased, and notice of invoice and payment was also given. This solicitors email and accountants letter being a waste of time. 
- No request to see accounts outside of heavy handed correspondence from his accountant and solicitor.
- Unilaterally deciding to stop paying into the house fund
- Unilaterally overriding a decision by the other freeholders to increase the monthly 'service charge' 3 flats agreed to raise our monthly commitment from £50 to £60. 
- Overriding a 75% vote to keep the panels fitted to the side gate following complaints from Hazem that the wrong wood had been used by threatening to employ a structural engineer, the cost of which would be charged to anyone in disagreement with him. 
  >  re: Structural engineer for a garden gate.. 
> 	  I will instruct a structural engineer for which I will have to forward the costs on in addition to any solicitor costs
