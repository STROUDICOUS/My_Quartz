Below is my reply email to Astute Accountants Letter. I gave my comments inline on Raheel's email.

> Dear Sirs,
> Without Prejudice
> We have been appointed by Mr Hazem Elakhnawy, a director and 25% shareholder in 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited (company number 03399596), referred henceforth as the Company, to review and provide opinion regarding the accuracy of records maintained and filed to the Companies House and HMRC for the Company. 
> We understand the Company was setup to deal with the day-to-day Management of the Property located at 50 Queens Avenue, London, N10 3NU which consists of 4 separate flats. Each flat owner is a director and a 25% shareholder in the Company.

It is my understanding that the primary role of 50 Queens Avenue Limited has been to hold the asset of the freehold which is jointly owned by the shareholders and to avoid having to change the Land Registry entry each time a flat is sold and bought, which can be very costly. This structure is common for Share of Freehold.

> We understand that Mr David S Jeffrey acts as the Chair of the Board of Directors and Mr Paul Stroud is the Company Secretary. In your position as the Chair and the Secretary of the Company you have been keeping records and complying with Companies House and HMRC requirements.

There is no Board of Directors position. As per above, 50 Queens Avenue Limited is exempt from Corporation Tax and doesn't not submit filings to HMRC. As far as I am aware, this has always been the case since incorporation in 1997.

> Our client has informed us that despite his numerous requests he has not been provided with the Annual Accounts of the company nor has he approved any accounts before submission to the Companies House. Should this be the case, you might be in the breach of Law as laid down under The Companies Act 2006. It explains in great details as to what are the Rights and duties of a Director or Officer of a Company are. We summarise them below for your ease of reference. 
> Rights of a director:
> • The right to access the company’s documents and financial records and inspect when required
> • The right to delegate any of their powers to another person, provided this is recorded in the company’s minute book an does not violate its constitution
> • The right to participate in board meetings and decision such as approving accounts for submission to Companies House and HMRC

There seems to be some confusion over your client's claim that he had requested to see the accounts. Hazem has not asked to see any accounts in my 4 years of being a director.  Neither David, or my predecessor (Pamela Learmonth), whom I recently contacted regarding this matter, has any recollection or record of Hazem requesting to see any accounts.

I inform all director/shareholders of account and confirmation statement submissions to Companies House. I am not aware of any time your client responding with any question of this or with any suggestion that he should have be consulted beforehand. 


> Our scope of work is to review the accounts submitted and records available thus far and whether any breach has been committed since being a director of the Company, he is jointly and severely responsible for the Company’s affairs, as explained above. We therefore, ask you to provide us with the following information within 14 days of the receipt of this letter:
> • ==Full set of accounts for last 6 years for the company
> • Company’s tax return for the last 6 years
> • Bank statements of house account for the last 6 years
> • Details of all transactions with corresponding receipts and description
> • Details of any correspondences with the Companies House and HMRC and any fines imposed by these organisations.==

With further conformation from the previous secretary, the bank account that all shareholders paid into was not in the company's name, and only acted as a simple kitty to put aside money for the buildings insurance and any work which was needed as required by our joint responsibility as Landlord. Oftentimes, this kitty had been insufficient for the totally needs of the property maintenance, and in such cases, shareholders have either sought payment arrangements direct to the vendor from each shareholder or, with prior consent from the other shareholders, paid in full themselves, later being reimbursed by the other shareholders for their share of the cost, with invoices or receipts presented or with prior agreement in the case of cash payments. 

Given 50 Queens Avenue Limited's exemption to corporation tax and lack of company bank account, there are no Company Accounts. There are some extended details of purchases and payments for services over the last 3 years which can be forwarded. 

Here is a receipt of the Late Filing Penalty - the cost of this was absorbed by myself only:

## Additional Notes not sent in my reply

- Hazem attended only one meeting in the last 4 years and as historically boycotted house meetings. He has said to me that this is because nothing gets done, which is demonstrably untrue. He also has a history of raising a agenda items, agreeing to obtain quotes for works he has suggested, failing to provide quotes, and then complaining that the work is not being done and often makes accusations of incompetence of the management company.
- The Company has filed dormant accounts for almost all of its time, since before Hazem resided at 50QA. He nor his conveyance solicitor has ever raised any issue with this before.
- As micro-entity submissions were no longer available to us from 2019, under advisement from Companies House, I made the switch from micro-entity to dormant company submissions. 
- It may be useful for you to note that your client was often in arrears of the monthly contributions to the house account, preferring instead to pay in bigger sums which on occasion put his contributions in advance of the mutually agreed £50 pcm. No one has or had any complaint at your clients payment structure. Eventually, your client made the unilateral decision to stop paying into the account altogether and since then, the freehold has been maintained; paying for goods and services as a 4-way split between the director/shareholder/leaseholders, with the bank account being abandoned.
- The presentation of accounts has never been routine practise for the company as it has been the same for 24 years.
- 6 years of accounts apparently do not exist and pre-dates my time The company does not submit tax returns Bank Statements MAY be possible
- I don't wish to share my appeal to companies house as it contains personal details, but surrounding documentation can be provided
