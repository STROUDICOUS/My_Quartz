## This section is for context
**24 April 2021**
Hazem first complaint about belongings in the communal area. This is out of scope, but it is here for context. I am not looking for representation to respond to this letter.

Email/Letter sent by Hazem's Solicitors

The letter contains misapprehensions - here are corrections
- Belongings were no longer left in communal area at the time of the letter. 
- Seems to assume that the freehold company is beholden to him (Hazem)
>	Our client is also unsatisfied with the way the freehold company is being run. All leaseholders are members and directors of 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited (“the Company”), with Paul Stroud of Flat A also serving as secretary of the Company
- Mentions a gate etc that needs repairing - Meeting Minutes reflect that Hazem agreed to obtain quotes for the work. He didn't obtain quotes.
- "the majority of leaseholders [were not] happy for Hattie Hughes of Flat C to become the new Company secretary"
- The house management is/was not "led principally by Paul Stroud"
- There were no "undeclared payments being made for alleged communal repairs"
**We did not respond to the letter** except to say that we would respond. Hazem has a history with Fat D where legal correspondence went back and forth - Hazem would escalate - so we decided in the end not to respond in any significant way

**20 August 2022**
First email from Hazem to raise issue of accounts.
See. https://www.dropbox.com/s/sc0redizt8lk5ew/20220820%2050%20Queens%20Avenue%20house%20matters.pdf?dl=0

- Says it was mismanaged "for over eighteen years"
- Unilaterally decides to stop paying into the house account - apparently with Hattie's say so
- Also says the legal action will be taken with anyone that still use it for the purpose of the house 
-  demands that there is no need for a house account
- Says " Bank statements are supposed to be provided on an annual basis". I am not aware of this and don't see any reference to it in my lease agreement. Also, I was given and extensive handover document by my predecessor - there is no mention of this need
