Dear Mr Leoussis, 

Thank you for your letter of 17.1.2024.

I stand by my email of 5.9.2023 agreeing to putting the administration of 50 Queens Avenue into the hands of a professional management company, as I see no possibility of consensus ever being reached between all parties in the house. 

I understand that application has been made to the First-Tier Tribunal, but I would hope that all directors will consent to the appointment of an external professional manager without needing to go to court.

Kind regards,

Hattie
