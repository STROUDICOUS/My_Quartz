This text should be in the "Link to Block" quote, but hdden in the email I'm quoting from ^fa7aac

The claim that my client has set up CCTV which captures Taghrid and Paulâ€™s back garden is a serious and false allegation (and one which can therefore be considered as harassment). Just because she can see the camera, as she states, clearly does not mean that the camera can see her, or look into their garden â€“ one can plainly see that the camera is directed down towards my clientâ€™s own garden and I have confirmed this myself by my client showing me what this camera sees on screen.  ^669282

As for Paul's email about the deadbolt sent on 13/01/2024, his video explanation of the lock is irrelevant to what happened on the night of 24/08/2023 which resulted in Hattie being locked out. He claims in the video that the issue is because once the lock is swivelled around and you put the key into it, you cannot turn the key. That is simply not what happened on the night in question when the key could not actually enter into the lock as it was being blocked by an object within the lock itself. My client had unlocked the deadbolt from inside to let Hattie in. Once again, this has already been explained to him. ^82190f

My client ==reiterates the claims he made in my email of 11th January and denies the version of events purported by Paul in his first email of 13th January== (which may be considered defamatory). His version of events and Davidâ€™s intimation of general innocence simply does not align with reality or the facts â€“ see corroborative evidence from Hattieâ€™s recent emails.

My client previously made every effort to reason with Paul, even going to the extent of paying for his dining experience at CÃ´te Muswell Hill and La Lluna on 16/10/2022, however his attempts at reconciliation were met with hostility, and Paul proceeded to make unfounded accusations against my client to the police the following day. This occurred after my client provided minutes of their meeting to the other freeholders. My clientâ€™s belief is that Paulâ€™s allegations appear to have been a ploy to escape liability for his breaches of his lease and his failures of director's duties. As already mentioned, these allegations have since been dismissed by the police. Despite this, the alarm and distress caused by Paul & Taghrid has very seriously affected my clientâ€™s health and he continues to suffer from their actions.

Please all be advised that I have now started the process of applying to the First-Tier Tribunal for a Court Manager to be appointed to manage the building under Section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (see attached preliminary notice being served). Although this shall increase the service charges annually for everyone concerned this appears to be the only way the building shall be properly managed.

Please be advised that Flats A & D continue to be liable to compensate my client for his ongoing legal costs in this matter.

Kind regards,

Spyridon Leoussis
