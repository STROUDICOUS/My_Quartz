**Dear neighbours, 

  

We hope this email finds you well. We write to you to update you on our situation following the emails we have all received from Hazem El-Akhnawy.  We have made the difficult but necessary decision to cease all communication with him hence he is not cc’d in this email. Hazem has made multiple threats by way of unauthorised demands or intent to claim money, often with an imposed arbitrary deadline. Equally troubling are the many photos of our belongings and our door attached in emails to us all. This behaviour is unsettling in itself and the constant surveillance is enormously distressing and scary, to the point that communicating with Hazem has become untenable. Our family has suffered greatly over several months, with both myself and Taghrid suffering from emotional distress, anxiety, and fear. This for anyone is tough, let alone for new parents. 

  

I want to take the opportunity to set the record straight over how and what I have done to try to resolve the issues we face. I reached out to Hazem to meet over a coffee so we could hopefully find a neighbourly way forward to 1) the fence issues with no.48 and 2) a resolution to what he considered outstanding regarding the letter to myself and Taghrid from NWL solicitors (which you all have a copy of). 

  

Regarding no.48: During my meeting with Hazem, I did not, and have never agreed to solely mediate or negotiate any recovery of money or otherwise with no.48. I suggested to Hazem that I organise a meeting with no.48, but with all directors/shareholders in attendance (either in person or electronically and optionally by proxy) so we could all get the full picture of the events to date. I mentioned to Hazem that it would be preferable if he attended but understandable if he did not want to due to his history with no.48. 

It’s our opinion that 50QA ltd follow the advice of the government guidelines around neighbour disputes and do due diligence before any legal action is considered. Hazem set arbitrary deadlines for me to resolve the issue with 48 or else we would all be responsible for past and future costs of the fence replacement. Being on the receiving end of these ultimatums is distressing. Irrespective of the illegitimacy of fence no.48 erected, neither the act of nor the cost of the panels Hazem erected were pre-approved by the company via any type of resolution or even informal vote. To demand payment from fellow leaseholders over two years later and apply the level of pressure and intimidation Hazem has over future costs; implying he has the right to do so is unacceptable. A freehold company should be making decisions about repairs, maintenance and other company matters through discussion and a vote before action is taken. Once the decision has been made for a particular repair, the presentation of 3 quotes. Our share of freehold is democratic; no director should be acting unilaterally.

  

Regarding the communal area and legal fees: No single leaseholder has the authority to dictate financial nor legal consequences from the other leaseholders for not doing as he says. 

I have had confirmation from three separate solicitors what common sense has been telling me: that demanding remuneration for the cost of a solicitor’s letter from its recipient is a spurious claim.

  
  

In an effort to persuade Hazem to abandon the demand of £240 I raised these points:

  

-   The pram had not been kept in the hallway for several weeks before the solicitor’s letter was sent
    
-   The solicitors letter cites a number of inaccuracies and false allegations in relation to my secretarial role and 50QA finances i.e. the portrayal of me as a manager, “undeclared payments” for “alleged communal repairs” and the assumed succession of the secretary role to Hattie. 
    
-   I have no legal obligation to respond. It is clear we do not leave belongings in the communal area, and have not for months. 
    
-   Any written confirmation, particularly one obtained by another leaseholder, would not be legally binding. 
    
-   And as Hazemn now wants us to confirmation in writing with his solicitors, I pointed out that the letter from NWL solicitors mentioned no such requirement nor would it because it’s not a legitimate demand.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  

A leaseholder does not have the authority or right to compel action, written statements or to demand or claim money owed to another leaseholder on contractual issues of the leasehold. Hazem is not the landlord of 50QA or of 50A QA and as such he would have to compel the landlord (50QA Ltd in this case) to take action, and it seems Hazem even knows this as the NWL letter correctly points it out citing lease clause 4.2.) However, as we’ve not left any personal possessions in the communal area for almost 6 months (with the exception of a wet umbrella left to dry on our doormat) it’s difficult to see what this action would be. 

  

One point Hazem makes in his email that I find particularly egregious is that he ‘tried to resolve this matter in a friendlier way’. Not only did he take the legal route prematurely and after we had compromised our position, removing the pram etc, his very first communication on the issue threatened to hold anyone that disagreed with him liable for the cost of a fire risk assessment. No gentle text message, phone call, knock at the door or word as we passed in the hallway in the 7 months since the birth of our son. Repeated emails threatening legal action and/or recovery of his costs cannot be labelled Friendly and he cannot assert that there was “no response”; we compromised initially by removing the bike at all times, made our apologies to all and removed the pram where we could until we were fully able to comply with the demand, shortly after obtaining a new pram and rearranging some things in the flat. We did this specifically to avoid further escalation, but the photos, the repeated demands for written confirmation  and payment of his solicitor’s fees is a step too far and we will not give in to this intimidation.

  

It is harassment to make repeated unauthorised demands to take action, financial demands or claims against other occupants. 

  
  

Simply saying “I’m going to do X and you’re going to have to pay me Y“ is wrong, and to pay it sets a dangerous precedent to those making such demands – no one should have this power. 

  

That’s fine, the dispute has been between Hazem and number 48. But should this widened to include 50 Queens Avenue Ltd, put us all in financial and legal harm's way. I believe it would be reckless to greenlight further legal action (including engaging a solicitor). At the very least we should be sure we have all the details and do our due diligence.
