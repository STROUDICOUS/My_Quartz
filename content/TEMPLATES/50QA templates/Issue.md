> As for Paul's email about the deadbolt sent on 13/01/2024, his video explanation of the lock is irrelevant to what happened on the night of 24/08/2023 which resulted in Hattie being locked out. He claims in the video that the issue is because once the lock is swivelled around and you put the key into it, you cannot turn the key. That is simply not what happened on the night in question when the key could not actually enter into the lock as it was being blocked by an object within the lock itself. My client had unlocked the deadbolt from inside to let Hattie in. Once again, this has already been explained to him.- From [2024-01-17 17.09 ~ Spyridon TO Taghrid (RE.
