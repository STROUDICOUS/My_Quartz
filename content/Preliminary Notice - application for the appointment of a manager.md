## THIRD SCHEDULE 

Matters relied on by the tenants 

1. Breaches of obligations owed to the tenants under Mr El-Akhnawy's lease for his Flat B in 

the Property: 

- a. Clause 4.1: "to permit the Tenant peaceably and quietly to hold and enjoy the premises without any interruption or disturbance from or by the Landlord or any person claiming under or in trust for the Landlord or by title paramount"; the Landlord has failed to prevent Mr El-Akhnawy from being harassed by other leaseholders in the building and to enjoy free unobstructed passage over the communal areas. 

- b. Clause 4.2: "at the written request of the Tenant to enforce by all means available to the Landlord the covenants entered into by any other tenant in the building"; the Landlord has failed to adhere to this despite being aware of the various breaches of leases by the other leaseholders in the building, including but not limited to Flat B's harassment by the flat owners of Flat A and D, Flat A's garden trees infringing on Flat B's right to light, Flat A obstructing communal areas of the Property. 

- c. Clause 4.3: "to observe and perform the obligations contained in the First Schedule [regarding landlord's duty to properly repair and maintain the building]"; Landlord's failure to ensure the inside and outside of the Property is regularly cleaned and maintained; Landlord's failure to carry out necessary Fire Risk mitigation works; Landlord's failure to remedy the lock in the communal front door for many years; The garden side gate needs to be repaired so it can be shut properly and locked- landlord's failure to do so is a serious safety concern; Landlord's failure to repair of the communal front path.
- d. Clause 5.6: Tenant not to do anything that may cause the buildings insurance to be voided or at risk; Landlord's failure to ensure other tenant's with similar provisions in their leases are not complying with this provision 
- e. Clause 6 First Schedule (Landlord's Services): "To do or cause to be done all works, installations, acts, matters and things as in the absolute or reasonable discretion of the Landlord may be considered necessary or desirable for the proper maintenance, safety, amenity and administration of the building"; failing in this duty as the Property has not been maintained, managed or repaired for years. 
- f. Clause 6 First Schedule (Landlord's Services): "To keep proper books of account of the sums received from the Tenant and the other tenants in the building in respect of the annual expenditure and of all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Landlord pursuant to his covenants in this Lease"; Landlord's failure to maintain proper books / accounts for communal expenditure for years and service charge monies going missing. 
2. Breaches of RICS Service Charge Residential Management Code of Practice Parts 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19 & 20 due to the reasons mentioned in the sub-paragraphs in paragraph 1 above. 
3. Other: There has been a complete breakdown of communication and relations between the four leaseholders/share of freeholders in the Property (it has reached the stage of Police being called by the leaseholders on each other) and agreement cannot be reached on the appointment of a third party local property management company and therefore the Property management has been entirely abandoned with the Property's maintenance and safety having been ignored for years (as no-one is willing to hold freeholder meetings); accordingly only a Court-appointed manager will be able to properly protect the building.

FOURTH SCHEDULE 

Matters specified in the Third Schedule which are considered capable of remedy; steps required to remedy them.

- The applicant does not believe any of the matters specified in the Third Schedule above are capable of remedy due to the complete breakdown in communication and relationships of the four leaseholders involved.
