## Dataview, properties incorporation, and presentation

### Dataview objectives
- Easy to link to and quote from evidence (emails, meeting minutes, etc)
- Dynamic List of quotes 
	- e.g. List of quotes where Hazem gave a false allegation

### General
-  Use Properties in notes to create...
- Timelines. e.g.
	- History of Hazem's actions that are to the detriment to the company
	- Timeline around "significant events"
- Tables of:
	- Email Threads
	- Email WHERE e.g. tag = `"#50QA/imposedDeadline"`
	- Any type of note where #todo 
		- e.g. Examples of Hazem invited to provide quotes but didn't.
- Inline tags to quote and comment
	- Use after checkbox. Checkbox’s can be queried
	- Use 3 tags for each callout 
	- Tags for call-out types. See [[./50 Queens Avenue/meta/CALLOUTS_and_MARKDOWN|CALLOUTS_and_MARKDOWN]]
		- Example warning or quote
		- **Why I need it:** To tell dataview query what Callout to render
	- tags for offence type See [[./50 Queens Avenue/Offences/Hazem’s Offences and Other Examples|Hazem’s Offences and Other Examples]]
		- **Why I need it:** 
	- tags for [[./Contentious Issues Raised by Hazem|Issue]] related to
		- **Why I need it:** Tagging the callout of quotes or sections from emails or meeting minutes is more effective than using note frontmatter (e.g., relatedTo: "Side Gate") because it ensures dataview only retrieves content specifically relevant to the issue, avoiding unrelated quotes.
### More on using dataview queries

# Sections of 50 Queens Avenue published response
- ## Introduction
	- A brief summary of Hazem's narrative
		- 
	- State that I will prove that much of the assertions and allegations Hazem has made against me, Taghrid, as well as David & Adrienne are false
	- I will demonstrate how Hazem has been the aggregator, and the obstructive person within the freehold company and the residents of 50 queens Avenue  
	- That he has acted illegally 
	- That he has harassed others by way of
		- Misrepresenting my responsibilities 
		- Coercion by holding others liable for his professional fees 
		- Coercion by threats of demanding 
		- False accusations
		- And lies 
	- I will demonstrate that [[./50 Queens Avenue/supporting information/Hazem El Akhnawy|Hazem]] has a history of this obstructive behaviour that not only supports my claim that he is not acting in the interests of the company but his own interests but that the impasse we find ourselves at now did not start with a pushchair in the communal area.

	- Outcomes that we want in place before creating a "line in the sand".
- List of issues as a timeline.

		- I am the one who has been hostile

	- Refute any false claim that [[./50 Queens Avenue/supporting information/Hazem El Akhnawy|Hazem]] or [[./50 Queens Avenue/supporting information/Spyridon Leoussis|Spyridon Leoussis]]has made.
	- I should provide evidence of a willingness to manage the property effectively. This demonstrates to the tribunal that the claim is false.
