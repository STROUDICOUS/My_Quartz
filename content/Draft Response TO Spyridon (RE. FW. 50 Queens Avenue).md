## Draft Response

Dear [[./50 Queens Avenue/supporting information/Spyridon Leoussis|Spyridon Leoussis]]

I hope this email finds you well. 

Firstly, I must express my urgent concerns regarding the Ring doorbell; recent information has raised serious privacy and child safeguarding issues.

We have learned that the Ring doorbell's motion detection capabilities are more extensive than represented in your previous communication. It is activated by movement not just at your client’s door but also near or at the other side of the bannister, directly affecting our child’s privacy and safety. Our child, is less than 2.5 years old, and inadvertently triggers the device simply by walking out of our flat and near the bannister, an area that should not be under surveillance. Given the seriousness with which my child’s nursery treats safeguarding—prohibiting phones and smart watches to protect the children—it is our hope that your client take immediate action and provide evidence that the Ring doorbell has been adjusted to not detect motion on or near the bannister to ensure our child's movements are not recorded. This evidence is crucial for our peace of mind and the safety and respect of our child.

Providing evidence of this adjustment is crucial for our peace of mind and the safety and privacy of our child. We kindly request that this matter be treated separately from other disputes.

We hope that your client will treat this request with respect and consider it quite separately from all other disputes. We look forward to a swift and constructive response to resolve this matter amicably.

Regarding the First-Tier Tribunal, I wish to echo much of what David has said in his response (Subject:Preliminary Tribunal response re 50 Queens Avenue N10) and I agree with Hattie's email (dated 21/01/2024) in full; I too see no possibility of consensus ever being reached between all parties in the house. We believe that a professional management service is the best course of action. I would have liked to explore the mediation route, as per [[Jonathan.M.Eldered|Jonathan.M.Eldered]]'s suggestion (email subject: Assessment of the situation), and have made this suggestion to all parties, but thus far have received no response or any suggestion that this view is shared by anyone else. 

We are working on providing some alternatives for the consideration of the directors and shareholders - we're waiting for one or two more quotes to come through so that we will have options. We too require input into the management company appointed.

I will address the other matters raised in this email and others in a separate, more detailed response at a later time. 

%%Furthermore, the CCTV camera's installation and its potential to overlook our garden, despite assurances to the contrary, necessitates a reevaluation. The implication that our concerns are unfounded, coupled with an insinuation about our understanding of the situation, is both incorrect and offensive.%%

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

## Email regarding Cameras and Ring Draft
I am writing separately to discuss an issue of privacy and safety related to the Ring doorbell installed by your client. It has recently come to our attention that the device's motion detection range is broader than initially reported, capturing areas that include the area adjacent to the bannister. This has unintended implications for the privacy and safety of our family, particularly our child.

~~To highlight how seriously other places prioritise safeguarding and privacy measures, our son's nursery does not allow phones or smartwatches inside the building.~~

 it is our hope that your client takes swift action to adjust the Ring doorbell to avoid detecting motion on or near the bannister. Providing evidence of this adjustment is crucial for our peace of mind and our privacy. We hope that your client will treat this request with respect and consider it quite separately from all other disputes. We look forward to a swift and constructive response to resolve this matter amicably.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Sincerely,

We have the right not to be recorded in accordance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This right is crucial in safeguarding individuals and families from unnecessary and intrusive recording and surveillance. The camera does indeed capture beyond your client's door and is recording us and, more concerningly, our child. 

The installation of CCTV in freehold areas breaks clause 3.8 from the Leasehold agreement. We have the right to prior notification and agreement to changes made to the freehold/communal areas.
