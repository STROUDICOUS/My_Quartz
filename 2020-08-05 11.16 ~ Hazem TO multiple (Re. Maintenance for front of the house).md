Hello all,

Just to clarify, I previously raised my concerns to everyone during August 2019 about the material used on the work carried out on the side gate which was organised by David, as the material was not for like and did not meet the same standards as the original used which also poses a security risk (as the wood he used is typically installed on garden sheds not on gates which require an element of security). This was also later agreed by everyone via email in August 2019. As for the other works such as the painting of both gates and ensuring that the wall by the bins is sturdy, this was raised in previous years (see house notes 26 May 2018).

I was also under the assumption that Martin would have been aware of these works which need to be carried out as the seller's solicitor should have legally informed him of any outstanding works which need to be carried out related to the property so there seems to have been some miscommunication on that part.

As for the works I had arranged for this week, this was done as I already arranged for the builder to do some work in my own flat and saw it as convenient to carry out the works which had already been agreed on discussed for a couple of years now. I believe the quote I was given was also very reasonable and I believe it is the cheapest quote we will be able to get for these works. However, as it seems that the rest of the house would prefer more time to arrange for these works to take place I have now cancelled my builder from doing them. It will now need to be arranged by someone else (as I am too busy to do it) within the next few months before the weather changes for the worst in October. If this is not done, I will have to take a legal route to ensure the necessary work is carried out and the costs will then be forwarded to everyone in the property as it will eventually devalue and cause damage to the property. I also do not want this issue to go on for much longer, including previous work raised in prior emails and house meetings.


Kind regards,

Hazem
