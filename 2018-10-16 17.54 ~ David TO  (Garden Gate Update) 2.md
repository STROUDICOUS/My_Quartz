Hello All,

The tradesman from Muswell Hill Hardware replaced the old panels in the gate
this morning. All went to plan except that the barrel of the Yale lock
needed to be replaced. I have placed new keys for the Yale lock in your
pigeon holes. For various reasons, when you use the new key the gate opens
if you turn the key anti-clockwise He was also able to restore the lower
lock which is now working. Don't throw away your ï¿½longï¿½ garden gate keys.
The panels have been treated a number of times with wood preservative. I
have one more coat left to do.

Regards.

David
