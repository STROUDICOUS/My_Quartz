# Questions

These are some questions that have simply occurred me - I don't understand the details fully. 

## Cost
### Can I expense this to the company?
The matter seems to be addressed as a Management Company issue of which Hazem seems to hold me and David Jeffery personally responsible.
### Can this be claimed on the buildings insurance?
I believe the buildings insurance covers legal. Can Hazem, as co-director and shareholder prevent this?
### Can I charge Hazem and Administration Charge?
I'm not sure if this has any relevance.

## Service Charge
### LPE1 form 
**According to the LPE1 (leasehold property enquires) form, the service charge is collected by the Management Company**

Does the LPE1 FORM match up with the Leasehold agreement Service Charge section? And/or section 7.8

### Is there any legitimacy to the 14 day deadline?
The 14 days seems unreasonable to me. This isn't a business; we all have full-time jobs.

If there is a Service Charge, as legally defined, is that, or should it have formed part of the account submission to Companies House?

### Is there an actual service charge?

Can it be argued that the Service Charge was in fact a kitty for insurance? This is how the Bank account own (flat D) and my Secretary predecessor and prior own of my flat describes it.
Particularly that Flats B+C stopped paying into the "service charge account"

Can a service charge legally be charged and received if it is not entered into Companies House accounts? other freehold limited companies seem to do this, where it's only the share capital i.e. 4 Ordinary Shares @ Â£1 each. 

Would there be a breach of contract if no service charge is made to the leaseholders? As per the lease agreement schedule 3? See [[Questions for my Solicitor#Unneighbourly conduct|Unneighbourly conduct]] - Unilaterally deciding to stop paying into the house fund 

Is it not simply that the Lease agreement is out of date in this regard as it pre-date the purchase of the freehold by the owners of the flats back in 1997?

### Other Questions
Does any of this invalidate the Dormant status of the company? And does that implicate me in any wrong doing?

If it is, am I as the former secretary responsible? If so, at what cost?

Does it matter that the company has been filing this way since its incorporation 25 years ago? And that Hazem has not mentioned this before? Particularly in relation to companies house submissions - his conveyancing solicitor would have advised him if there were any problems with the current arrangement. As would all other leaseholders since incorporation. 

How many years are accounts needed to be kept for? For both so-called service charge accounts and companies house filings. Is there anything else in missing?

Doesn't Hazem, as co-director, implicate himself in any alleged mismanagement? Particularly as he has demonstrably not been a neighbourly or cooperative member of the freehold/company.
