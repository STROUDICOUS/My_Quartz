To restart all proceeding for the upkeep of 50QA:
- Hazem to drop all claims for monies he claims is owed to him for professional fees he has incurred
- Hazem (addressed to Hazem but is applicable to Al) to stop using threats of incurring costs should other members not agree with him. 
- Hazem and all to recognise that no one (particularly Paul and David who his claims have been regarding) has any greater obligation or responsibility to 50QA than any other member. Past or present.
	- With the exception of Paul's role as secretary. Paul absorbed to costs for late submission 
	- And anyone who has agreed to take any further responsibility 
- Hazem agreea to informing, discussing and waiting for a democratically agreed cost of action before entering into extensive dialogue or particularly any legal response to matters affecting the free hold. e.g. Boundary fence. 
- Hattie to agree not to halt democratic proceedings 
- Not to sidline any vote system, enforce policy change by making demands upon individual shareholders without bringing it to the board. e.g. No cash payments, 14 or 21 days notice, no payments for services personal from personal bank accounts. 
- Hazem not to make unfounded claims or complaints against other members. 

## Old text for solicitors 
Note: At this time, I am seeking representation for myself only, but I may team up with Flat D (see [[Background Details|Background Details]].doc) 

My first priority is to delay the proceedings; to put the brakes on any further action to be taken by NWL solicitors of Hazem. Particularly if a response cannot be formed by NWL's 14-day deadline, which will be **Thursday, 16th Feb 2023**.

I ultimately want this all to stop.  Hazem has made my life miserable since April of 2022. I need Hazem to stop taking further action on the matters he has raised thus far on this matter or for any other retrospective matter. I will take it under advisement on how this may be achieved. 

I need to know what options I have - even consider no response to some or all of Hazem's points.

It may be important to note that Hazem has a track record of continuing with the legal route. However, I have not seen him or heard of any action going to court; back-and-forth letters with Flat D's solicitors resulted in Flat D agreeing to pay Hazem in an effort to make the whole thing go away. We must consider and try to avoid this oneupmanship. I believe that NWL Solicitors do a lot of work for Hazem, and he can access their services easily and cheaply. 

I can't decide whether to, as much as possible, de-escalate and, crucially,  not provide more subject matter to pour over with tedious back and forth. Or to take a firmer stance, correct all his misapprehensions, and remind him of his own misconduct, which may be used against him as a consequence of further action taken by him?

### Suggestions

**I make the following suggestions under advisement from a solicitor in consideration of the above **

- Point out where it could be considered that he is in breach of contract or legislation. Perhaps as a hint of further action should he pursue matters (or new matters) any further.  

- Clarify or correct any point that is not necessarily an actionable point or one that a response has been asked for ie Correct the following false statement “The management company was principally led by Paul Stroud”. 

- To convince him that I do not have the responsibilities or duties he thinks I do and therefore has little to gain by training his sights on me. 

- Highlight Hazem’s duty to be a cooperative and constructive director of the company at first and not primarily take an adversarial stance. Evidence his heavy-handed approach. 
  
- That the matters raised do not warrant further grievance as the nature of the management company and the occupants of 50QA are non-professional property owners (with the exception of Hazem, who does not take on any responsibilities) 
  
- Is it worth turning off Hazem's solicitors? Mentioning and evidencing his extensive un-neighbourly conduct. My thinking is that if NWL are made aware of Hazem's behaviour, and evidence is shown to them that Hazem has got some information wrong and that his behaviour could be called into question, and that it could be argued that he is sabotaging the company without prior cooperation, then perhaps NWL my advise Hazem to drop the matter?
