##  question to Answer Me

Hi there, 
I am a director and former secretary of a private ltd of a freehold of four flats (four shareholder/directors). As far as I can tell, the formation of the company was to manage the currents owners of the freehold via shares, rather than update the deeds each time, which I believe is costly. The company was formed 23 years ago, I bought a flat and became secretary four years ago. Director "D" had a bank account (not a company bank account) which each flat owner would pay £50 into each month to put aside for maintenance and buildings insurance. This arrangement was setup many years ago, before my time in the property. Director "B" has complained that the bank account has been mis-managed and made mention of fraud, and 4-5 months ago stopped paying into the account, as did director "C", although they made no such claim. Since, all shareholder/directors have collectively agreed to stop paying into the account. Director "H" is misinformed. The details of the ins and outs of the bank account were not well kept, but there has been no fraud and all transactions over the last ~4 years have been explained.

The problem is that Director "B" is vindictive and determined to cause a stir, I suspect due to another dispute regarding personal posseions in the comunal areas. 

My question is, what kind of problems can he cause for me (as former secretary and co-signiture of the bank account) and Director "D"?





# Potential Arguments from Hazem

## £50 pm was a service charge, not a kitty. 
- If Hazem is asking as a leaseholder then he can only ask for 1 year of service charge accounts. Correct?
- If it was a service charge then Hazem was frequently in arrears. 
- The service charge mentioned in schedule three would be accompanied by some type of agreement on amount. Not sure I see any. Maybe mention of £100 not 50
- ...which is one example that demonstrates that part of the leaseholder contact are not  completely relevant as it predates the@ joint ownership of the freehold
- Money was set aside in a kitty as prescribed in Clause 7.8 of the Leasehold agreement. **The Management Company**. This section makes the provision for the scenario (which we are curently in) that the leaseholders become owners of the freehold. 

## Disagreement that 50QA Ltd is not the same as the function of the landlord 
50 Queens Avenue Limited is the name on the land registry but is not the functioning landlord
- If we ceased to be directors it would not absolve us of our duties as co-landlords
- It is common for share of freehold to be structured this way. If other freehold companies are dormant are they all too filing unlawfully?
- Given how the accounts were submitted in 98, it's clear that the intention was to structure the company as it is now
- No services or goods have been billed to 50QA Ltd. 
## A demand for a refund of expenses without invoice or receipt
There was from time expenses that were paid in cash for which there is no receipt - I am  concerned that Hazem will want to make a thing of this, demanding a refund and the cover of his legal costs to do so.
- Except for regular payments, notification was given to prior to any expense
- No objection was raised when David would email the co-freeholders, notifying them that an expense was made


- 50 QA Ltd is not responsible for keeping 6 years of account for the purposes of the company outside what has been submitted for the last 24 years. 
- According to the LPE1 (leasehold property enquires) form, the service charge is collected by the Management Company

However,  
 - Here are accounts for the last 3 years. This is a gesture of good will as it goes beyond what is legally required of PS and DJ. 
 - For clarity, PS did not ' take the Barton' on expenses. Flat A was a proactive member of the freehold and regularly participated in the up keep of the common areas, but did not administer the remuneration of any expense they or any other member of the freehold incurred. 
- Given the examples attached of bullying shown by Hazem, and the lack of cooperation on the matter of the accounts demonstrated by the adversarial nature of his enquiry this gesture should be received thankfully.

## Points to Raise
- Your client my characterise this matter as financial mismanagement, but there has been
- Your client cannot simply absolve himself of all responsibility simply because he refused to attend meetings or because he had distanced himself from the administrative responsibilities and duties.
- No personal financial lose to any of the leaseholders. Except...
- Those that have lost out are those that took a more proactive role in what is supposed to be shared responsibility - the administration and arranging of works and maintenance.
- (whilst there has been a collective disbandment, the Bank account was opened and used with the approval of the directors at the time of opening. This was a democratic choice
	- Bank account is no longer in use
	- The current directors agreed to discontinue this arrangement
	- The remaining funds were correctly redistributed to the freehold members following discussions via email
	- The decision to stop using the account was not voted on
- I am being asked to respond to a letter that contained misapprehensions. I addressed some of those issues and I am still being referred to that same letter without any framing of alteration to the questions. 
- Have not taken the Baton on the matter of expenses
	- David would reimburse other freehold members for the Buildings insurance premium payment
	- Where there had been approval from the freehold, he would reimburse out of pocket expenses. e.g. Cost of Steam cleaning the communal carpets.
	- David would email the freehold members with notification of the reimbursed expense
	- David also gave regular updates as to the available funds at house meetings and after significant payments such as the buildings insurance.
	- Paul Stroud, was not part of that process in any way.
	- Your client has mischaracterised my role in the freehold in prior communications. I cannot be considered to have led any management of 50 Queens Avenue. I took a proactive role in its upkeep, and
	- I was appointed secretary to take over from the person I bought my property from, Pamela Learmonth.
	- Your client did not want the role
	- The Smarts were largely absent and Mr.Smart suffered with dementia
	- David had already been in the role of managing the house fund

	- ~~The Companies Act 2006 does not define the company secretary’s duties but a number of functions are considered to be their responsibility. As an officer of the company, the company secretary is potentially liable (along with the directors) for certain breaches of the Act (for example, failure to make certain Companies House filings).~~
	- All company responsibilities are joint and several.
- Urge cooperation.
	- Directors should work with the other directors to attain an amicable outcome to issues that we all decide need addressing
	- Collectively seek the advice and services of professional should one be needed. 
	- As has often been the case before, your client chooses to take a heavy-handed and adversarial route where queries haven't been raised, discussions haven't even had, without approaching anything that could be described as exhausted. 
- Request for accounts - I Can't be expected to respond to enquiries I am not in receipt of.
	- Meeting minutes do not reflect you clients purported request. 
	- indeed, if your client did feel we had missed his request, a simple reminder would have sufficed. By contrast...
	- Hattie did make a request and she was subsequently furnished with account details
	- Her recommendation was to cease the use of the account
	- To cease payment into the House Account with cash, as was the preference of your client
- Expenses that went toward repair and refurbishment of 50QA were made without any withdrawal from the house account. 
	- Whilst I have object to such an arrangement
	- It does muddy the waters and become difficult to track 
	- The only records of such expenses are via email chains
- To my knowledge, there has never been a practise of presenting accounts to the freehold members.
	- This was the prerogative previous freehold members.
- I enclose the account submissions to Companies House that have been freely available to your client as they are public record
	- These records are present and correct and since they
	- Are a matter of public record
	- I'm not sure what the desired outcome is here
	- These have been submitted this way since 1998.
	- Were are not subject to Corporation Tax and therefore do not submit Tax Returns for 50 Queens Avenue Limited
	- Before there is any question over this arrangement, I must point out
		- This is standard practice for structuring Share of Freehold
		- Successive Conveyance Solicitors have had eyes on this without raising the issue
		- This would include your clients own Conveyance Solicitor

## Draft - unordered

With your assistance, I would prefer to work in cooperation with your client, and perhaps persuaded Mr.El-Akhnawy to soften his adversarial stance on this matter and focus on correcting any issues we collectively identify. 

The first step in correcting any issues has been to stop using the previous bank account. No personal financial loss has been suffered by any Leaseholder. 

Possible action we might take collectively as directors would be to appoint a managing agent or create a company bank account. Of course this would be subject to discussion amongst the freehold and be subject to a vote, but I feel confident we can all find an amicable solution.

If your client would like to take the baton himself (or by assignment of duty), I would surely endorse this. As equal members of the freehold I encourage him to take equal interest in the day to day. 

Previous bank account served the purposes of, and was agreeable to the residents at that time it was opened. Until recently, this remain the case. Now we're in a position where we, the current freehold members and directors want to change that arrangement - nothing more. ==It was perfectly reasonable for Hazem to object the use of this account.== 
==We can fix this. It's also worth pointing out that successive conveyance solicitors have had eyes on this==

That your client is asking for tax returns and HMRC correspondence is alarming. That a company director of --Years doesn't know that the company doesn't submit tax returns, nor that it is not obliged to.



==Apologies for the down to the wire response. I am a busy father, a self employed freelance composer and this last week suffered with covid. David no longer has the capacity to respond to such correspondence, so I will do my best to be==

==I an unable to respond more substantially, because I have a job as a full -time self-employed composer and I am a father of 16-month old child==. Whilst I have submitted accounts and confirmation statements to Companies House, issued shares, and updated records of company officers, it is not my responsibility to maintain the ins and outs of the house expenditure. ==The Companies Act 2006 does not define the company secretary’s duties but a number of functions are considered to be their responsibility. As an officer of the company, the company secretary is potentially liable (along with the directors) for certain breaches of the Act (for example, failure to make certain Companies House filings). However, those Companies House Filings have been made.==

==I enclose photocopies of the passbook of the house account which clearly shows regular deposits of each flats service charge of £50 before you client took the measure of demanding we all stop using the account.==

Details of house expenditure were emailed prior to and at the time of an expense, or, if a house meeting was imminent, attendees were notified during the meeting - minutes were always recorded and distributed to all directors. ==To discover the details of an outgoing line item, my suggestion is that your client may filter emails based on the sender (in gmail one can search for e.g. from: hazem.e@hotmail.co.uk) and filter further by using dates that enclose the date of the line item in question by a week or so.== 

==For example, a transfer of 1303.96 was made to myself to reimburse the purchase of the Buildings Insurance on the 17/09/2019. By searching for emails from David Jeffery for the month of Sept 2019, one will find the meeting minutes which detail the transfer. Another search for Taghrid.C.V@gmail.com (my wife) in the preceding month shows the Buildings insurance quote and details of the policy once purchased.== Your client, as always was cc'd on these emails. In short; the records are adhoc and unordered, but remain in all our possession. No-one has taken the baton to put them into a spreadsheet or otherwise. 

There is no clear definition of the roles of the individual directors, but we are of course equally responsible.

It is important to note that successive Conveyance Solicitors have had eyes on the company records (which are publicly available) and associated bank account without raising any red flags. With particular regard to the Companies House submissions, they have remained the same since 1998, long before your client's own conveyance solicitors would have reviewed them.

DELETE?
Your client even tries gaslighting me, making a claim in an email to the freehold that he ‘tried to resolve this matter in a friendlier way’.  Not only did he take the legal route un-necessarily - it was actually after we had removed the pram and any other personal affect, his very first communication on the issue threatened to hold anyone that disagreed with him liable for the cost of a fire risk assessment. No gentle text message, phone call, knock at the door or word as we passed in the hallway in the 7 months since the birth of our son.
DELETE?

The bank account was largely for Buildings Insurance

In November we reported your client to the police for harassment, citing multiple threats in a number of emails that made serious, unilateral demands, often with the intent to claim money from us that we did not owe him.  He often made threatening demands that anyone that is in disagreement with him will be liable for the cost of whatever endeavour he is insisting on, often with imposed arbitrary deadlines. Also forming part of our complaint were the many, equally troubling photos of our baby's pram and our flat door that your client sent us, sometimes late at night. This behaviour was unsettling in itself and the constant surveillance was enormously distressing, to the point that communicating with your client became untenable. This behaviour and the constant surveillance of our family, our baby's pushchair, and the door to our own flat is deeply troubling and scary. My family has suffered greatly over many months, with both myself and my wife suffering from emotional distress, anxiety, and fear. 

I'm not sure what is meant by 'mismanagement of the service charge account', or the' inter-party correspondence'. However, this demonstrates another type of harassing behaviour you client exhibits; making numerous, spurious claims, often inflating my position and responsibility and holding me falsely accountable, or by a series of other misapprehensions with serious implications that I am expected to correct. Your email is a continuation of this harassment in this regard, and that of your client's demonstrable use of unduly, heavy handed, intimidating tactics, without first exploring any reasonable and constructive discussion, only now done indirectly.

I provided Astute with information that may have prompted Raheel to reframe his line of questioning. He said he was going to '*review and provide opinion regarding the accuracy of records maintained and filed to the Companies House and HMRC for the Company*'. And so this escalation to the level of a solicitor's letter with threats of disqualification proceedings and the recoupment of legal cost of such a venture, is one more act by your client designed to intimidate his neighbours - it is harassment.

The reason I said that there is no record of your client asking to see accounts is to point out that no one can be expected to respond to requests that they are not aware of. Minutes from the 17th September 2020 house meeting do not reflect your client's claim. The minutes were circulated after the meeting and your client had not raised objection to them. They are attached.

Regarding the house account, it is important to point out that it was not my responsibility. The account was principally used to pay for the buildings insurance. My predecessor characterised it as a kitty, primarily for this purpose. All freehold expenditure was voted upon and once there was agreement from the freehold, payments for repairs/maintenance would either be made directly from that bank account or David Jeffery would reimburse whichever of the flats had paid the service. e.g. Cost of Steam cleaning the communal carpets. Following an email from the payee with the details, David would  then email the freehold members with notification of the reimbursed expense, often with updated details of the available house funds. David also gave regular updates of the available funds at house meetings, shared in meeting minutes via email. We were proactive in seeking repairs, cleaning, and maintenance of 50 Queens Avenue not because we bare any greater responsibility than the other directors, or that we led in any respect, but because we care about our home.

All of the company records pertaining to Companies House are available on public record. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03399596

Attached is the Companies House email in PDF format. I paid for the late penalty fee myself, this was not cov

I enclose the ruling from companies house regarding the appeal. I do not include the whole email as it contains sensitive, personal information the I do not wish to share. It is worth noting their stance on the joint responsibility of the Directors. Despite this and the fact that my predecessor was compensated from the house account for a similar fine, I personally absorbed that cost.

I expect this to conclude matters barring any reasonable question that as co-director, I am obliged to answer.
