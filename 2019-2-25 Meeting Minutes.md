– Paul will also undertake the role of Company Secretary and will make
necessary changes to Companies House entry for 50 Queens Avenue.
– Share certificate was signed by David Jeffrey and Mary Smart and given
to Paul Stroud.

– The current balance in the House Fund is £1199. Flats A,C and D have
paid up to date. Flat B has paid up to the end of December 2018.
– Paul has agreed to be the additional signatory to the House Fund
account. David will pass on the relevant form for Paul to take to
Nationwide.
4. Notification of Works
– It is estimated that necessary works in Flat A will commence on 11th March
2019 and continue for approximately 2 weeks. Taghrid and Paul will supervise
these works.
5. Communal Entrance.
– It was agreed that the communal entrance area could possibly be cleaned by
the cleaner of Flat A and the cost to be reimbursed from the House Fund. Paul
and Taghrid will also investigate the cost of carpet cleaning. Any cleaning
would make more sense after the works in Flat A are completed.
6. Garden Path
-Clearly this needs to be rectified and will be explored after current works.

7. Entrance Light
– There was general agreement that an entrance light would be preferable and
this will be investigated.
