## Summary

## Email Message
Dear Sirs,

As you will be aware I act for Hazem El-Akhnawy in relation to 50 Queens Avenue, Muswell Hill, London, N10 3NU.

I am instructed that there have been successive years of financial mismanagement of the service charge accounts of 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited, as set out extensively and quite clearly in inter-party correspondence to date.

I am also instructed that my client’s accountant, Raheel Shams of Astute Accountants sent both of you letters dated 16th December 2022 which you have yet to respond to with any substantiveness. Mr Stroud, you purported to reply to this letter by email dated 6th January 2023. This failed to provide any actual information required under the terms of Mr Shams’ 16th December letter. You state “Neither David, my predecessor (Pamela Learmonth) or myself, have any recollection or record of Hazem requesting to see any accounts” This is untrue as my client had requested this information in the 17th September 2020 house meeting by my client and Harriet Hughes. You also state “There are some extended details of purchases and payments for services from the account in David's name over the last 3 years which can be forwarded” please forward all of these documents for review, including specifically evidence of all communal expenses for the last 6 years (both invoices and evidence of payment for these expenses).

As you may be aware Schedule Three of everyone’s lease requires the Freeholder to maintain accounts of actual expenditure and keep proper books of account of the sums received from each leaseholder in relation to service charges. The two of you had of course taken the baton of dealing with these expenses on behalf of 50 Queen’s Avenue Limited and you are therefore duty-bound to have maintained such records, which are awaited. You will also be aware of your responsibilities under the Companies Act 2006 section 388 which requires that Company records must be kept at its registered office address and must be made accessible for inspection by the Company’s officers.

Please be advised that depending on the information provided (or lack thereof) I am instructed to commence director disqualification proceedings against both Mr Stroud and Mr Jeffrey.

The required information set out above and in Mr Shams’ 20th December letter is required within 14 days of the date of this email, failing which I am instructed to issue the aforementioned proceedings and claim legal costs as part of such proceedings.

Kind regards,

Spyridon Leoussis
