## Summary

## Email Message
Evening

I have read this and the previous email concerning the slamming of the side gate.

Mine is only an opinion as pointed out to my previous email to all residents.

In relation to the gate banging on the building when someone comes through with their vehicle.

One option would be to change the side of the hinges so that the gate then opens to the right onto the fence rather than onto the property itself. May not stop all the banging.

As for the CCTV.

I have a couple of factors concerning this unless all residents may be in agreement.

I have no problem with the idea of CCTV outside the property. Good security.

Inside the communal area then that is more restrictive. Was there a discussion regarding this.

Being private property I am not aware of the legal obligation or privacy act of CCTV monitoring residents.

If you were all in agreement thatâ€™s fine but one question I would ask. Who has access to any footage.

I will leave this with yourselves.
