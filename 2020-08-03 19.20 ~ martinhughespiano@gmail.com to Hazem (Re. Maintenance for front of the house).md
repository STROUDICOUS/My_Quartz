# Summary

# Email Message
Dear Mr El-Akhnawy, Dear Everybody,

Thank you for sending me this mail. I didn't know about these repairs.

I presume by painting the two front walls, you are referring only to the terracotta coping, and not painting over the stonework. The photos the agent sent us are probably very old, as the terracotta paint looks in better state than the rest of the paintwork of the house, especially the gable. But certainly the pointing could do with some attention.

The agent said that normally the responsibilty for painting/restoration of the exterior of the house lies with the management company, so happy about replacing the gate. It would however be useful to know whether this would apply for instance to other woodwork, like the exterior of windows, or the balcony railings, or only to parts of the house that are used by everybody?  ^420f0d

Anyway, I very much hope that Harriet will be able to discuss all this with you at the next meeting. 

She aims to arrive later in the month, regulations permitting!

All good wishes,

Martin Hughes
