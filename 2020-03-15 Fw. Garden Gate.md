# Summary
# Email Message
Dear Adrienne and David,

I am writing this in reference to the email correspondence in which I explained that the materials used for the building work which were organised by yourselves on the side gate must be carried out with materials which meet the same standard as the original materials which were in place prior to the work taking place. This was mentioned to you on 04/10/2018 via email prior to you actually organising the work to be carried out. This has since been discussed numerous times in which I mentioned that if the works are not amended to meet the same standard then I will instruct a structural engineer for which I will have to forward the costs on in addition to any solicitor costs if the outcome is that the materials used in the recent works carried out do indeed not meet the standard and quality of the original materials that were in place. ^[[[Coercive Financial Ultimatum|]]] 


I have obtained a quote from a structural engineer of £432.00 inc VAT from the structural engineer. If no response is given within 14 days in relation to amending the works then I will have no choice but to go ahead with instructing the structural engineer.

I will also include a copy of this within your pigeon holes for reference.

Kind regards,
